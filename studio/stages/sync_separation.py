"""Camera-ambience extraction (remove the camera's own voice, keep the room tone).

When the recorder's clean voice and the camera's built-in-mic voice both play on the
final timeline, their ~tens-of-ms offset is heard as a doubled/echoed voice — even
though lip-sync is fine, two near-identical voices comb-filter. Plainly ducking the
camera would also kill the ambience the editor wants. Instead we run a source-
separation model over the camera audio to strip the *vocal* and keep the
*instrumental* (= ambience/room tone), and lay that on its own lane next to the
synced voice. The voice then comes only from the clean recorder track, with no echo.

The separator (audio-separator + a RoFormer model) lives in a SEPARATE Python venv
(``.sep-venv``) because it needs an older Python than the main app; we invoke it as a
subprocess. The model runs on the GPU.
