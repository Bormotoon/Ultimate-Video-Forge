"""Acoustic cross-correlation for sub-frame lip-sync ("Boundary Flex").

Whisper word timings are only ±50–100 ms accurate. This module measures the true
recorder<->camera lag directly from the audio waveform — independent of the
transcript — using PHAT-weighted cross-correlation (GCC-PHAT, ``gcc_phat``), which
is robust to the different mics and reverb of camera vs recorder.

``refine_piece_boundaries`` (Boundary Flex) uses this to acoustically nudge each
rendered piece's recorder start so speech lands under the picture to sub-frame
accuracy, independent of Whisper's word timings. A measurement is only trusted when
its cross-correlation peak is confidently sharp (silence/wind/music windows are
rejected) and the residual exceeds a deadband, so it only removes real drift rather
than injecting GCC measurement noise.

    Pieces are contiguous in OUTPUT (camera) time, beginning at ``lead``: piece i's
    local start is ``lead + sum(out_dur[<i])`` where ``out_dur = rec_dur / factor``.
    For each piece we cross-correlate a short camera window at that local time against
    the recorder window at the piece's current ``rec_start``; if the peak is sharp and
    the measured residual exceeds the deadband, the BOUNDARY between this piece and
    its predecessor moves by it (clamped).

    Moving the boundary — not just this piece's start — is what keeps the plan free
    of content gaps and overlaps: the previous piece's duration absorbs the shift
    (its factor is recomputed so its OUTPUT length grows/shrinks by exactly the
    output this piece loses/gains), the shifted piece keeps its own tempo factor, and
    every later piece's output position is untouched. The old behaviour slid the
    whole piece window without touching the neighbour, so a −80 ms nudge made the
    last 80 ms of piece N and the first 80 ms of piece N+1 the SAME recorder
    content played twice — the mid-word micro-repeat («подга-га-товил») users
    heard with Boundary Flex enabled. With sentence-wise plans the boundary sits
    in room tone and the neighbour is a pause piece, so the absorbed shift is
    inaudible by construction.

    Both tracks are decoded to mono 16 kHz numpy arrays exactly once (regardless
    of piece count), and every boundary window is a slice of those arrays — no
    per-boundary ffmpeg subprocess. The independent measurements are spread
    across a thread pool (``gcc_phat``'s FFT calls release the GIL, so threads
    parallelize this fine and avoid the fork-safety concerns of a process pool);
    the geometry is deterministic, so the result is identical regardless of
    worker count. ``tmp_dir`` is accepted for backward compatibility but is
    unused now that no scratch files are written.

    ``rec_track`` lets the caller supply an ALREADY-DECODED recorder array.
    Every render job used to decode the whole recorder again: at 16 kHz mono
    float64 that is ~461 MB per hour of recorder for the final array alone,
    before intermediate copies — repeated once per clip, so a shoot of many
    clips against one long recorder paid that I/O and allocation over and over.
    One decode per recorder, reused across its jobs, removes the repetition
    entirely.

    # The previous scheme moved the boundary and let the predecessor absorb the
    # change in BOTH its source and its output length: piece i's onset went to
    # s+δ while its output start went to L+δ/f. Those cancel exactly — an event
    # at recorder time R was output at L + δ/f + (R − s − δ)/f, which is
    # L + (R − s)/f, its original position. Boundary Flex logged "nudged N
    # onsets" and moved no audio at all; a −80 ms correction on the middle of
    # three pieces left a recorder event at 107 s on camera 7 s exactly where
    # it started.
    #
    # What actually moves speech is to change WHERE each piece reads while
    # leaving WHERE and HOW LONG it plays alone. Every piece keeps its output
    # window, so the plan's total length and every later piece's position are
    # invariant by construction (see pipeline.validate_pieces); each piece's
    # source window becomes [t_i, t_{i+1}) with t_i = s_i + δ_i, so the recorder
    # content stays exactly contiguous — no skipped audio and no double-played
    # sliver, which is what the boundary scheme existed to avoid. The tempo
    # factor absorbs the difference. An event then shifts by −δ_i/f at the
    # piece's start, easing linearly to the next boundary's own correction —
