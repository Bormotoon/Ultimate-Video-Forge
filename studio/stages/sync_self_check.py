"""Post-render self-check: verify a rendered voice monolith against the
camera clip's own transcript, with an optional repair pass.

``--verify``/``tools/verify_sync.py`` already measures realized LAG between
the rendered voice and the camera audio via GCC-PHAT cross-correlation — but
it is blind to CONTENT defects (a dropped word, a duplicated phrase, a piece
built from the wrong recorder span): it only measures *where* two waveforms
correlate, so a piece with wrong-but-present speech can still show a small
lag if enough of the surrounding audio still lines up.

This module closes that gap by re-transcribing the rendered voice monolith
with Whisper and comparing its words against the camera clip's OWN
transcript (already computed during alignment — the natural "original" to
check against, not the recorder). The two transcripts should describe the
same speech at (very nearly) the same local timestamps if the render is
correct; a span where they diverge — either a timing drift beyond normal
cross-run Whisper jitter, or words that simply don't match — is flagged.

Two modes build on the same detection: "warn" (the default) just reports
flagged spans for the user to check in the NLE; "repair" additionally
re-aligns each flagged span's own small stretch of recorder audio (transcript
re-match first, falling back to a local GCC-PHAT re-check the same way the
acoustic fallback / Boundary Flex do) and re-renders only the pieces inside
that span — the rest of the clip is untouched. Both a `shifted` (timing-only)
and a `content` (wrong/missing words) span get the SAME treatment: an ffmpeg
render is deterministic, so re-rendering the same recorder span verbatim
would reproduce a content defect byte-for-byte — the only thing that can fix
either kind of defect is re-deriving where in the recorder this piece of
speech actually comes from, i.e. a fresh local alignment.
