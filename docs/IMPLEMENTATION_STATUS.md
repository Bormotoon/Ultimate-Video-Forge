# Implementation status

This file distinguishes implemented contracts from plan items that still need
legacy migration or external acceptance. It intentionally does not mark a
phase complete merely because a similarly named module exists.

## Implemented and verified

- Source snapshots, source provenance, Python 3.12 locks, CI matrix, wheel and
  PyInstaller resource smoke tests.
- Deterministic two-camera/recorder/drift/pause/retake/GoPro fixture generator.
- Versioned project, artifact manifest, transcript, four-time-domain,
  SourcePlacement, AudioWarpMap, and EditMap contracts.
- Two-phase planner, JSON-lines events, subprocess runner, cancellation,
  owner-token locks, and atomic publication.
- Media scan, prepare input declaration, Whisper stage facade and content
  cache, affine text-anchor placement, timeline transcript, deterministic
  pause rough cut, program transcript mapping, microphone energy attribution,
  neutral sequences, FCPXML and XMEML serializers.
- CLI `scan`, `plan`, `run`, and `doctor`; initial PyQt QProcess desktop shell;
  isolated module manager; owned llama-server lifecycle.

## Requires further implementation

- Full characterization/golden migration of WhisperSync matcher, RANSAC,
  acoustic fallback, strategies 1/2/3, piece renderer, Boundary Flex,
  ambience, enhancement, self-check, repair, segments, and verification.
- FCPXML behavior parity for connected clips, auditions, roles, synchronized
  rendered audio, relative relinking, multicam, and rough-cut markers.
- Editable Material screen, persistent manual overrides, RecorderTrack model,
  camera/speaker assignment, multicam switching, and edit decision auditioning.
- Forge proofread, article, term check, analysis/reels selection, reel render,
  subtitle burn/editor save contract, YouTube fetch, and unattended batch.
- Model download UI, module settings UI, first-run wizard, auto-tuning, and
  production installers for all three operating systems.

## External blockers

- A private 20-40 minute two-camera plus recorder sample has not been selected
  in this workspace.
- Final Cut Pro and Premiere Pro versions and machines are not available in
  this environment, so import, relinking, lip-sync, and multicam acceptance is
  open.
- The required overnight channel batch run has not occurred.
- Clean-machine installer acceptance on Linux, Windows, and macOS has not
  occurred.
